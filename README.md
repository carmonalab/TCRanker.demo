## Ranking TCRs by gene signatures using TCRanker

In this repo we host code and scripts to run [TCRanker](https://github.com/carmonalab/TCRanker) in different settings.

* Quick start with TCRanker to rank CD8 T cells from B16 mouse based on exhaustion level: [TCRanker demo](https://carmonalab.github.io/TCRanker.demo/demo.html)

* Combine scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq in Seurat, prior to running TCRanker: [TCRanker data prep](https://carmonalab.github.io/TCRanker.demo/preparation.html)

* Obtain full-length TCR sequences from TCRanker results using the [stitchr](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkac190/6553689) tool: [TCR reconstruction](https://carmonalab.github.io/TCRanker.demo/stitchr.html)
